Olivia De Lesantis is a writer and creative director from Naarm. Her work primarily involves goddesses of deduction and ladies of ill-repute. She is an ardent feminist, and her poetry seeks to explore and unpack the various nuances of her womanhood. If her writing was a person, it would wear the finest gourmand fragrance and shoot from the hip. Olivia works as Creative Director at Stories Connecting Us; an emerging, innovative literary space for writers and readers. She is Director and Founder of Aphrodite’s Blush Creative Services; a freelance marketing agency centred around assisting businesses to connect meaningfully with their customers; website coming soon! You can connect with her via her Instagram – @livandothermysteries.
