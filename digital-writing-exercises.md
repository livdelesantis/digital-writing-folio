# Digital Writing Exercises and Reflections - Liv De Lesantis 

## Week One - What do you think digital writing is?
<p>Digital writing to me is the junction of the written word and the use of technical elements to bring ideas and stories to life.</p>

## Week Three - Coding Playground Remix Reflection: 
I wanted to add a link straight through to my test site which we changed up using the original template that Jenny issued us. [Click here to view my coding playground](https://liv-de-lesantis-test-remix.glitch.me/).

Responding to the questions for the week:

### What aspects of the remix are the same?
I've kept the overall feel of the piece the same, in that I've reflected on the intersections between technology, mental health and relationships and tuned that towards my own experiences and feelings currently. I've also kept the structural framework of the coding the same, as I'm still learning how to utilise all the functions in the CSS, Javascript and HTML areas. 
### What aspects of the remix are different?
I changed up the inputs for the Toroko Gorge remix, the Google Search function and the notes app poetry to suit the narrative of coming out of a relationship recently and the oscillating flurry of emotions this comes with. I've also woven in a lot of experiences or common phrases that I've seen on dating apps recently, though re-worded to suit the Haiku constraints - or combined with dystopian-themed adjectives as inspired by the original 'dystopian dreams' remix to further illustrate this digital world of romance; or lackethereof. I think I struggled a lot trying to come up with search engine results that felt tied into this narrative, as a lot of what has helped me is actually staying away from googling advice, I much prefer talking to those closest to me about these themes. Actually, the search inputs I populated the "searching" drop-down with are more accurate, as they have to do with how I am healing myself from this phase in my life, and where I am investing my time and energy. I also played with formatting elements, and discovered that for some of my Google fonts to work, I needed to paste the code into the head section of the HTML coding page. 
### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
I think it flows together in such a way that reads thematically connected for me and my lived experience. I really like the more homemade feel that it has in comparison to a polished website - there is something journal-like about it that comforts me. I had a few bits of broken code throughout and was struggling with some formatting issues, so turned to GPT in order to help identify the cause of it, and was then able to fully remix it in line with the narrative that developed from initially looking at my notes app in the first lesson we worked on this.
