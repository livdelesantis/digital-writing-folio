# Digital Writing Exercises and Reflections - Liv De Lesantis 

## Week One - Introducing E-Lit and Digital Writing & About Me and My Practice
### What do you think digital writing is?
Digital writing to me is the junction of the written word and the use of technological elements to bring ideas and stories to life. I think the distinction between "flat writing" - i.e: simply blocks of text published in the digital realm - and "digital writing" is that the writing itself must be mobilised by an interactivity between reader and text. I think there needs to be an element of play and of agency for the reader - in that they are not simply just "reading" words  written on a digitised platform, they are experiencing, choosing, acting and even modifying the text. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to further develop my coding skills, particularly in the realms of CSS - as I've used HTML and "block coding" through platforms like Wordpress in my profession. I really want to explore how I can intersect coding with my creative practice, primarily in a poetry sense, as I think that would lend itself well to customisation or "remixing" the variables to create something new with each reading. I also expect to fail a lot! Although I've used basic coding at work before, this is very out of my comfort zone - it feels more technical than I'm used to, with more structure and constraint; something I struggle with in my own writing practice, and constantly try to enforce. 
### My Writing Style and Practice 
* I write primarily cosy crime/crime fiction and feminist/historical poetry. Most of my published work revolves around the pursuits of devious women who have left their mark on history - fictional or otherwise :D
* I usually use my laptop to write. I used to be a Pages fanatic, and do still enjoy using it for when I want zen writing space - i.e: somewhere I can write without the distraction of a cluttered dashboard or loads of comments. However, I mainly utilise Google Docs for workshopping convenience, and for sharing real-time updates with editors. I always have a journal on the go - it is typically an unorganised conglomeration of thoughts, phrases, excerpts, scenes, plots or characterisations that either I've observed in real-life, or which have occured to me whilst day-dreaming. 
* I believe I have to be reading a lot to be writing well. I think it wakes up my vocabulary and unclogs my writers block - to be surrounded by words, ideas and characters helps to hone my technique. I also find I read more like a writer when I'm in the swing of reading books. I tend to try to be observant and jot things down before I forget them, no matter where I am. Some of my most fruitful ideas have struck me in the strangest of settings or most innocuous of times - for example, the protagonist in my cosy crime novel got her name whilst I was watching a game of football and there happened to be a Watford player whose surname was Cleverley. Thus, inspiration struck for a stylish, fastidious, blunt and quick-witted detective.
* As an over-describer, I frequently write short stories to the guidelines of competitions or magazines that specify a word limit. This trains me to be more succinct and to focus on telling the story - I find that this has greatly improved my grasp on pacing and plotting. 
* I also frequently utilise music and ambiance as a tool when I write. I need to steep myself in the feel of the place my story is set in.

## Electronic Literature Collection Reflections: 
* ### The Fall of the Site of Marsha - Volume 1 (2006):
As a coded narrative within a website with a host of characters, values and plot-points, this works as a piece of digital-writing. We don't just read the various different stages of Marsha's descent into paranoia, we are encouraged to click through and experience the story in a non-linear fashion. It almost builds a universe, in a way that regular analogue writing perhaps cannot. Where analogue writing cannot so easily play with form, structure, layout and visuals, this piece can portion out text to be interacted with individually, or create a "breaking of the fourth wall". This happens when Mike accidentally includes a "hidden" exchange between himself and his wife in a "password access only" section. The digital medium also allows the strikethrough throne angel voices to feel even more ominous, because there's an element of voyeurism created by the format of a message board. This made me think about how I could weave crime fiction into coding - I think I was surprised about how expansive the project can be; this piece has multiple sites, click-throughs and hidden elements that would work wonderfully for e-lit crime fiction. 
* ### Letter to Linus - Volume 2 (2011):
This piece reminds me of a labyrinth and an unfurled rubix cube - the more you click, the more variables there are, and you get small vignettes of conversational debate pertaining to each topic. You can 'create a narrative' by selecting different options to respond to the italicised question at the end of each mini essay. I personally feel that this weaving together of narratives, as done by the reader, classifies this as e-lit because it introduces that element of playful form and unexpected possibility. I like how it feels that you're in conversation with the piece - the tone reads as spirited back and forth with someone familiar. There is a sense of autonomy there that creates a collaborative poetry. I think I could utilise elements of this structure to code 'call and response', allowing the reader to interact with the poem and craft their own meaning. 
* ### Hobo Lobo of Hamelin - Volume 3 (2016):
I wanted to pick something more diverse in its elements than the previous two I've reflected on so far. This piece combines not only written word, but animated 3d illustrations that remind me of a pop-up book in the way they're contrasted with 2d backgrounds. As a piece of e-lit, this work is identified by its mobilisation of audio, visual and motion elements - perhaps more so than its interactivity. Although there is not a 'choose your own adventure' style for this piece, the reader is directly interacting with the text by adjusting volume and clicking through the slides. This work reminds me a lot of a comic book, but given a more transportive quality by the moving images and designs. Maybe it was the fantasy/fable setting, but as a piece of digital-writing, I found this piece was particularly effective in creating a strong world-building narrative. 
* ### forgotten nights - Volume 4 (2022):
* I loved the interactivity and simplicity of this digitised poem. Just as there are thousands of stars in the night sky, there are thousands of combinations of poetic phrases that allow for the text to constantly evolve and take on new meanings. In this manner, it is not just a poem - it will forever be changing into something more, something that is incapable of being pinned down or defined. Having a "narrator" or someone who actually reads the poem to you as it develops also elevates this piece beyond simply the written word - you feel as though you're collaborating with the poet themselves, crafting this piece together. As with the other examples that I've examined, there are also endless remix and reset options so that you can create entirely new patterns every time you press play on the poem. I think that carrying the 'night sky' metaphor through the piece, especially in combination with the visuals, tied all the elements together seamlessly. I think one of the strengths of e-lit in comparison to analogue lit that I've discovered in reading this piece is the ability to round-out a creative concept - you can really immerse your reader in the mise en scene of your writing with the use of various digital elements. 

## Week Three - Coding Playground Remix Reflection: 
I wanted to add a link straight through to my test site which we changed up using the original template that Jenny issued us. [Click here to view my coding playground](https://liv-de-lesantis-test-remix.glitch.me/).

Responding to the questions for the week:

### What aspects of the remix are the same?
I've kept the overall feel of the piece the same, in that I've reflected on the intersections between technology, mental health and relationships and tuned that towards my own experiences and feelings currently. I've also kept the structural framework of the coding the same, as I'm still learning how to utilise all the functions in the CSS, Javascript and HTML areas. 
### What aspects of the remix are different?
I changed up the inputs for the Toroko Gorge remix, the Google Search function and the notes app poetry to suit the narrative of coming out of a relationship recently and the oscillating flurry of emotions this comes with. I've also woven in a lot of experiences or common phrases that I've seen on dating apps recently, though re-worded to suit the Haiku constraints - or combined with dystopian-themed adjectives as inspired by the original 'dystopian dreams' remix to further illustrate this digital world of romance; or lackethereof. I think I struggled a lot trying to come up with search engine results that felt tied into this narrative, as a lot of what has helped me is actually staying away from googling advice, I much prefer talking to those closest to me about these themes. Actually, the search inputs I populated the "searching" drop-down with are more accurate, as they have to do with how I am healing myself from this phase in my life, and where I am investing my time and energy. I also played with formatting elements, and discovered that for some of my Google fonts to work, I needed to paste the code into the head section of the HTML coding page. 
### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
I think it flows together in such a way that reads thematically connected for me and my lived experience. I really like the more homemade feel that it has in comparison to a polished website - there is something journal-like about it that comforts me. I had a few bits of broken code throughout and was struggling with some formatting issues, so turned to GPT in order to help identify the cause of it, and was then able to fully remix it in line with the narrative that developed from initially looking at my notes app in the first lesson we worked on this. 
### How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
I think the distinct change about my opinion of coding now vs Week One is that it really is in the details - I thought, going into this course, that the overall cohesion of the code would be key to producing pieces that function and look the way you envision. However, the more I practice these techniques, the more I've realised it comes down to correct syntax and use of conventions in formatting. This felt like a hyperobject before we started. I hadn't really used this kind of code much in my work, and when I had, it was usually through a lot of troubleshooting with WordPress CSS forums - so actually being able to input customisable code that I understand is a big advancement for me. 
### Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
Since we were shown the 'Inspect' function that is available on different websites and e-lit pieces, I've been really interested in looking at the internal mechanisms of how different projects function digitally. I think it gave me much more of an insight into the layers that go into building interactive narratives - there's so many variables that have to be accounted for in order to give playability and to world-build/storytell within the constraints of the form; including lack of audio, limited visuals, controls, word limits, etc.
